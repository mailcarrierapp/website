MailCarrier allows you to choose between two ways to sign in: **Standard** (Email + Password) or **Social**.

### Standard

During the installation (`php artisan mailcarrier:install`) you should choose to *not enable social authentication*.  
From that point, you can run from your terminal the following command to create new users.

```js
php artisan mailcarrier:user
```

<img src="/images/create-user-on-install.png" alt="User creation on installation" class="rounded-lg shadow-md dark:border dark:border-slate-500 dark:border-opacity-40" />

You can choose to let the system generate a random password for you by leaving that field empty.

### Social Authentication

If you would like to enable the social authentication instead of the regular one, you can choose it during the Setup Wizard or setup it later by running:

```js
php artisan mailcarrier:social
```

A list of providers will prompt to auto-install the needed dependencies and configuration.

Once selected, configurations and additional dependencies will be added to your project. Further instructions will be shown to complete the installation.

<Aside type="caution" title="Redirect URL">
    The redirect URL must be your App URL with `/auth/callback` at the end.  
    For convenience, you can use `"${APP_URL}/auth/callback"` as value to automatically inject the App URL, just be sure to properly set the `APP_URL` environment variable.

#### Other providers

If your provider is not present in that list, don't worry! MailCarrier uses **Laravel Socialite** to handle social authentication, that means that you can choose from over **150 providers**!  

To get started, go on [Socialite Providers](https://socialiteproviders.com/about/) and find your desired one.  
In the page of your provider you will find all the instructions to complete the integration that usually are:

1. Install the dependency;
2. Add the configuration to your `config/services.php` file and `.env`;
3. Listen to Socialite event with your provider.

Finally, remember to set the `MAILCARRIER_SOCIAL_AUTH_DRIVER` in your `.env` file to reflect your provider name (all lowercase).

    We got you covered! Take a look at our recipe on [how to integrate Discord](/docs/examples/other-social-provider) as social authentication provider.

#### Granting access from social auth

By default, for security reason, every access from social authentication are **denied**. Of course you can customise and decide how and when a user should be allowed to sign in.  

To get started, open the `app/Providers/AuthServiceProviders.php` file.  
In the `boot` method you will find a callback to tell MailCarrier whether or not accept the current user from a social auth flow and, by default, it returns `false`, meaning that every access is blocked.

```php
MailCarrier::authorizeSocialAuth(function (\Laravel\Socialite\AbstractUser $user): bool {
    return false;
});
```

By accessing the `$user` variable we can, for example, grant access only to a specific email domain:

```php
MailCarrier::authorizeSocialAuth(function (\Laravel\Socialite\AbstractUser $user): bool {
    return str_ends_with($user->getEmail(), '@mailcarrier.app');
});
```

In this case, only the emails from `mailcarrier.app` will be allowed.  
But there's more! If your provider returns additional fields, such as *roles* or *permissions*, you can access those variables to create a fine-grained check.

```php
MailCarrier::authorizeSocialAuth(function (\Laravel\Socialite\AbstractUser $user): bool {
    return in_array('admin', $user->roles);
});
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Inspect the user">
    To inspect the content the current `$user` variable, try to write `dd($user);` inside your callback, before any return, and sign in!
