### Install

#### 1. Run the Setup Wizard
Run the following command in your terminal to start our handy install wizard.

It will clone a fresh **Laravel** application in a folder named `mailcarrier`, install MailCarrier and the needed dependencies.

#### 2. Setup your database
Once the first setup is over, go and edit your `.env` file inside your brand new `mailcarrier` application and edit the **database** environment variables according, for example:

```js
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=mailcarrier
DB_USERNAME=mailcarrier
DB_PASSWORD=supersecretpassword
```

To know more about database configuration, you can read it on [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/database#introduction).

#### 3. Complete your installation
Inside your terminal run the last command to complete the process:

```js
php artisan mailcarrier:install
```

It will install the dashboard and let you choose how would you like to authenticate your users.

#### 4. Run MailCarrier
Inside your terminal run this command to spawn a web server for MailCarrier:

```shell
php artisan serve
```

Now open your browser, navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) and have fun!
