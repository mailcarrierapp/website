Everything in MailCarrier goes around two concepts: **Layouts** and **Templates**.

### Layouts

Layouts are shared views that can be reused across your templates. They are *not required* to create a template, but generally recommended.  
A layout will contain the basic HTML structure and everything that should be shared such as **header** and **footer**. By doing so, in your templates you can focus on the actual content.

By default new layouts have a HTML skeleton, feel free to edit as you wish, just remember to place `{% block content %}{% endblock %}` wherever you want to render your template content.

### Templates

Templates are the actual core of MailCarrier: they contains the email content and all the related design.

On creation it will automatically generate a `slug` based on the template name: you will use this value to populate the `template` variable when sending a mail.

When making the HTTP request to send a mail, it's easier to read and understand what the template `welcome` refers to, if compared to a UUID 🔖

### Syntax

If you're familiar with JS, you will find the syntax very easy and friendly: [**Twig by Symfony**](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/templates.html) is being used as template engine, providing a fast and expressive way to write your templates.  

<Aside type="note" title="Learn more">
This sections only covers a few examples, but Twig offers a lot more: find out everything about the syntax on its [official documentation](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/templates.html).

```twig
<p>Hello, {{ name|capitalize }}!</p>
<p>Here's your recap:</p>

<ul>
{% for item in items %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ item.href }}">{{ item.caption }}</a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
```

Now how we used a [filter](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/filters/index.html) on the `name` variable to apply some transformation and then, with a [loop tag](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/tags/for.html), we print the content of an array.
